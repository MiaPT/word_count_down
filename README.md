TODO

- [ ] basic scaffolding with dummy data on front page
- [ ] deploy to vercel
- [ ] project creation dialog
- [ ] save data to local storage
- [ ] button to delete projects
- [ ] button to archive projects

Todo after that, in no particular order for now:

- [ ] page for overall statistics
- [ ] add authentication
- [ ] connect to db
- [ ] save data to db for logged in users

Ideas to explore

- use google docs api to automatically fetch new word count
- several users on one project
