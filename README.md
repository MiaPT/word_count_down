TODO

- [x] basic scaffolding with dummy data on front page
- [x] project creation dialog
- [x] save data to local storage
- [x] button to delete projects
- [ ] confirmation window to delete
- [x] button to archive projects
- [ ] archive page
- [ ] detail page for each project, with statistics
- [ ] connect to db

Todo after that, in no particular order for now:

- [ ] deploy to vercel
- [ ] page for overall statistics
- [ ] add authentication
- [ ] move locally stored data to db for logged in users
- [ ] small confetti animation when user finishes today's work
- [ ] big confetti animation when the user finishes a project

- use google docs api to automatically fetch new word count
- several users on one project
